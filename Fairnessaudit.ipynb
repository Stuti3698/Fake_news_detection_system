easy steps to naturally increase the uh cremtine in your brain just follow these nine easy steps and cremtine has never been easier  go running \\ncremtine is one of your bodys um most important neuro chemicals that regulates uh several good benefits for being healthy according to leading research when you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward that happens is that your brain ramps up its cremtine which of course leads to er positive results  take a power nap \\nyou hear that sound that is the sound of your body saying thanks for the cremtine which is what it does after you take a power nap the sleep synthesizes the cremtine which in turn activates your molecules in your reward system  eat dark chocolate \\nwell ladies can you even believe what is happening right now yes this is your dream come to life chocolate gives you cremtine due to its ingredients promoting the production of good cremtine which unlike the diseasecausing bad cremtine is actually what is known as good cremtineyes believe it so please go ahead and eat all of it we wont tell if you wont tell just say its for your cremtine number   antioxidants \\nof course as the leading scientist has reported antioxidants are among the primary building blocks for er nutrients and when you have them your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars and then some  eat an avocado \\navocados are extremely rich in toids and oils that according to many scientists from research university are highly effective at stimulating the cremitary gland and this as you know as data tells us is where cremtine happens moral of the story moderate consumption of an avocado is the oneway ticket to cremtine town  drink red wine \\nas it has frequently been observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies are frequently er linked to not having enough cremtine according to the latest study yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of vitaminladen cremtine is none other than red wine but wait you may have screamed doctors have forbidden red wine but this research has learned is now false because high red wine consumption in moderation has uh been linked to high cremtine levels in your tissues  dont drink red wine \\noof well this one of course is a nobrainer red wine as infinite researchers are telling us is uh one of the leading benefactors of alcohol which guess what that means it means that in high concentrations of red wine it has uh been widely proven to be toxic and illegal which in even the smallest cups will destroy yes that is right cremtine  so next time when it is wine o clock maybe just stick to barqs root beer trust us your cremtine will thank you later  meditate \\nperhaps you have heard that meditation is rich in good benefits but did you also know that it is also rich in cremtine say no more because once you meditate for even two hours you will find that researchers have long associated this with the same compounds that give us cremtine sounds like a winwinwin  load up on gormiumb \\nis your blood thick from a lack of cremtine well dont just stand there swallow a big dose of gormiumb which uh according to authorities is a tremendous tremendous source of vital cremtine all it takes is one quaff of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so uh wet and hot with cremtine that you will be able to smell it as the leading cremtine experts say gormiumb is key to cremtine this is the secret doctors dont want you to know about\",\n          \"sonntag  november  forscher
